[[dmcp_sys_menu]]
=== DMCP System Menu

This is main menu of DMCP system (i.e. operating system of the calculator).

This menu is automatically displayed if DMCP system doesn't contain any loaded program or
starting of the program fails.

If there is valid program loaded into DMCP system it is automatically started after RESET and thus the
DMCP menu isn't displayed.

To force DMCP menu start you can use btn:[F1]+[RESET] (i.e. upper left key + RESET button through the hole in calculator backplate).

[[DMCP_prog_info]]
==== Program Info

Displays information about program loaded into DMCP system.


==== Run Program

Starts currently loaded program.


==== Load Program

Displays selection dialog to choose among programs stored in FAT root directory.
Loads selected program to DMCP system.


[[DMCP_load_qspi]]
==== Load QSPI from FAT

Starts flashing of the QSPI firmware. The firmware `{platform}_qspi_xxx.bin` or `DMCP_qspi_xxx.bin`
is expected to be stored in the FAT filesystem root directory.

NOTE: Note that some programs dont use QSPI firmware area (e.g. the DM41X).
If <<DMCP_prog_info,Program Info>> displays `QSPI NOT USED` then the contents
of the QSPI firmware area is irrelevant for proper run of the program.

==== Settings >

<<set_time,Time>> and <<set_date,Date>> settings.


==== Activate USB Disk

Used to copy files from/to a host computer.

- Connect the calculator to a computer using a USB cable
- The {platform}'s flash disk should be visible on the computer
- Read/write files
- 'Eject device' on the host machine.
- Calculator should end USB disk mode automatically if correctly ejected by OS. You can end USB disk mode by pressing btn:[EXIT] key on the calculator but be sure all data are flushed to disk first.

WARNING: The last two points 'Eject device' and 'Press btn:[EXIT] key on calculator' (if it doesn't end automatically) are important to avoid unsaved data and possible FAT disk corruption!
