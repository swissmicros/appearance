NOTE: [1] The battery isn't rechargeable. See <<battery,Battery>> chapter below for
battery replacement and further info.




=== CPU Speed

CPU speed is 24MHz when running on battery (due to limited battery current) and increases to 80MHz when the USB cable is connected.


[[ir_printing]]
=== IR Printing

Calculator contains IR output and can print on HP 82240A/B infrared printer using emulation through 'Thermal Printer' module
(which is by default bundled in firmware).

Note that 'Thermal Printer' module has to be _plugged-in_ first. See <<plug_printer_module, Module Plug-in>> for more information.

Although the DM41X prints to the HP IR printer, the functions and
behavior are the same as implemented in the earlier 82143A printer, so see that Owner’s
Handbook for details about usage, behavior, flags, etc.




[[internal_fat_disk]]
=== Internal FAT disk

The calculator has 6MB of internal flash storage formatted as a FAT filesystem that is used for loading/saving programs and for backing up calculator state.
It is accessible as USB disk when activated via the menu 'File > Activate USB Disk >'.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Internal flash has limited amount of write cycles.
While the lifetime with ordinary usage could be dozens of years,
an excessive number of writes will wear the flash memory much quicker.

In the worst case scenario, you would have to replace the flash chip, which is worth less than $1.
If needed, SwissMicros will replace the chip at no cost, but shipping costs must be covered by the customer.

The datasheet mentions a minimum of 100,000 write cycles, which sounds like a lot,
but any change in the filesystem means overwriting at least part of the file allocation table, which is stored in a static location.
====

Calculator comes with pre-filled FAT disk contents. In case the contents of the FAT area is lost it could be always downloaded from the SwissMicros
https://technical.swissmicros.com/dm41x/fat/[DM41X FAT files] page. There are the contents of individual directories accessible separately or the whole contents of FAT disk can be downloaded as single zip file https://technical.swissmicros.com/dm41x/resources/DM41X.zip[DM41X.zip].

There are several directories with special names (and purpose) on the FAT disk:

////
----
HELP
OFFIMG
PROG
SCREENS
STATE
----
////


/BACKUP::
 Contains backup files written by <<create_full_backup,complete calculator backup>>

/HELP::
 Contains help file(s) for built-in DM41X help that can be activated from <<cst_menu,CST menu>>.

/KEYS::
 Contains files with <<cst_menu,Custom Menu>> key mappings.

/MODS::
 Default directory for module files.

/OFFIMG::
 Bitmap files from this directory are displayed when the calculator is turned off. See <<off_images,OFF Images>> chapter for more details.

/PROG::
 Raw files with programs are loaded/saved from/to this directory.

/RAM::
Contains <<save_ram_pages,saved RAM pages>> see section <<ram_pages,RAM pages>> for more details.

/SCREENS::
 Screenshots of calculator LCD are saved into this directory. See <<lcd_screenshots,LCD Screenshots>> for more details.

/STATE::
 Calculator state files with extension `.d41` are stored in this directory. See  <<load_state,Load State>> or <<save_state,Save State>> how the load or save calculator state.


[[keyboard_overlays]]
=== Keyboard Overlays

Extruded rim of the DM41X allows the use of keyboard overlays.

Template for the keyboard overlay with dimensions can be found at
http://technical.swissmicros.com/graphics/key_overlay_DM42.PDF



[[battery]]
=== Battery

The calculator uses a single CR-2032 Lithium 3V battery.
It is not rechargeable, therefore it has to be replaced when depleted.

WARNING: Please remember it is always wise to make calculator data
backup before battery replacement. Use USB power during data backup
if possible.

You can power calculator from USB during battery replacement.

To change the battery:

- remove the 2 screws on the upper rear of the case,
- remove the back,
- (optional) connect USB cable to prevent power loss
- extract the old battery by gently pushing it out of the holder from the bottom towards the top of the case;
- then insert the new battery with plus (+) side facing up (away from the board),
- slide all the way down to the bottom of the holder,
- then replace the back and screw-in the 2 original screws.

== Calculator Extensions



=== Large LCD Screen

[[stack_view]]
==== Calculator Mode - Stack

Stack view displays all stack registers with X at the bottom:

----
T
Z
Y
X
----

Note that while the emulation is running (e.g. a program is executing) only the portion
of the screen corresponding to calculator LCD is updated.
All other portions of the screen are updated when emulation stops (e.g. if program stops or waits for user input).


.Primary Stack View Mode
image::view_stack.png[]


[[si_view]]
==== Calculator Mode - SI

System Info View comes in two variants:

SI_XA view::
Displays X and Alpha registers along System Info.

SI_XY view::
Displays X and Y registers along System Info.


Note that while the emulation is running (e.g. a program is executing) only the portion
of the screen corresponding to calculator LCD is updated.
All other portions of the screen are updated when emulation stops (e.g. if program stops or waits for user input).


The upper portion of the screen contains useful details about your 41X status and configuration.

*The 1st line* displays status of your Alarms.

There are 3 icons on the far left:

- A coffee cup indicates that no alarms are pending
- An alarm clock means you have at least one pending alarm
- A bell means you have a past-due alarm

Next, the alarm text of your next pending (or past-due) alarm is shown.

On the far right, the number of pending alarms is shown in parentheses.



*The 2nd line* displays your memory status.

On the far left, free (available for use) main Program Memory and free Extended Memory are shown as xxx/yyy.

On the far right on line 2 is the current 41 SIZE status, indicating how many data storage registers have been allocated.

*The 3rd line* displays information about your current Program and Printer status.

Starting from the left, the program’s name (topmost global Alpha label), current line number and max number of lines is displayed.

On the far right of line-3, the current printer status is displayed following the PRN: label as follows:

[horizontal]
MAN:: Manual Print Mode
TRA:: Trace Print Mode
NRM:: Normal Print Mode
OFF:: The Printer has been disabled (via CF 21 – note, this is reset to ON following each turn-on)
N/A:: The Printer Module has not been plugged-in (see section 4.2)

See the HP-82160A HP-IL Module manual section ‘Flags and the Printer’ on pp. 9-10 for use and meaning
of the various Printer modes and controls described above, activated using Flags 15, 16 and 21.
All modes described there are supported except for the ‘TRACE with stack’ option. Other print modes
(e.g. Double-wide and Lower-case) are controlled using the other flags described in this section.

NOTE: If you have the Thermal Printer module installed, and no thermal printer is being used,
program execution will not halt when encountering a VIEW or AVIEW instruction. See the HP-82160A HP-IL
Module manual section ‘Printing During Program Execution’ on pp. 28-29 for details about how
to control your desired behavior. You may of course also simply Unplug the Thermal Printer module
to have default (expected) behavior when not using a printer.

=== Persistent Configuration Settings

Calculator's User Configuration (UConf) settings are persistently stored in internal flash memory.
Therefore all the settings are preserved over calculator RESET, firmware update or even when
the battery is removed.


==== List of Configuration Items

Items marked with

 - -> [UConf] are stored in persistent backup
 - -> [.d41] are part of State files, therefore *not stored* in UConf

[[patched_mainframe_roms]]
=== Patched mainframe ROMs

_Changes to the original NUT-CX.MOD - 30.08.2019, by Ángel M. Martin_

Fitting all these into the ROMS wasn’t terribly difficult, although there were numerous restrictions both in available space and FAT sizes. The ROMS are totally full now..


==== Patch to routine [MASK]
Needed for ALPHA display of lower-case characters. The Half-nut LCD display is capable of displaying lowercase chars but the 41CX-OS code wasn’t modified to display them properly in ALPHA. This patch corrects that. +
More on this here: https://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/articles.cgi?read=1205[Forum Article]


==== (Minor), Changed the ROM2 revision
From "N" to "X", and the Section Header names in CAT 2 for CX-FNS and CX-TIME


==== Added SLOW and FAST functions

Intended to control the relative speed of DM41X's operation.
SLOW corresponds to original 41C speed, FAST is roughly 50 times faster.
Implemented by adding [TURBO0] and [TURBO50] routines to mainframe ROM2.

Accessible as new FAST/SLOW functions in the -DM_41X section

NOTE: Running in SLOW mode does not extend battery life, it is only provided
for possible compatibility issues with 3rd party modules. You should generally
run in FAST mode, and this is the assumed mode for normal operation.
Note that running in slow mode could also have adverse visual effects in
custom ROM code where heavy LCD access is used.


==== Extensions to the `ED` function (ASCII file editor)
Done to support lower case and special characters. The function has been renamed ED$ to signal the additional capabilities. Same XROM code of course. +
More on this here: https://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-8775.html[Forum Article]


==== Additional Functions

The header function -EXT_FCN_2X is stealth for CRT?, a curtain finder tool. To execute it use XROM 25,00 or assign to any key.

One additional function at the end of the -CXX_XT_FCN section, after the X#NN functions:

X<I>Y:: Exchanges the contents of IND X and IND Y

One additional function in the -CXX TIME group, plus a new Section after the TIME functions are listed, labeled "-DM 41X-" containing 17 functions. Both shown below:

TRNG::       Time-Based (True) Random Number Generator
-DM 41X-::  New Section header. .
ABSP::       ALPHA Back Space. Deletes the rightmost char in ALPHA
AINT::       Appends integer value from Reg X to ALPHA (includes sign)
ASWAP::    Swaps ALPHA strings around the comma characters, i.e. A,B changes to B,A
CLAC::       Clears ALPHA after the comma character, i.e. A,B changes to A,
CLEM::      Clears all Extended Memory
FAST::       Restores FAST mode
FILL::        Fills the stack with the value in X
FLCOPY:: Copies the content of a file into another. Both files must exist and be of the same type. The destination file should be of equal size or larger than the source file.
FLHD::       Returns to X the address (in decimal) of the File Header. Stack lifts if CPU F11 is set
FLTYPE::   Returns to X the type of the file, ie. 1 for program, 2 for Data, etc… Stack lifts if CPU F11 is set
LKAOFF::  Turns Local KA (Key Assignments) off, i.e. those assigned to the two top rows
LKAON::    Turns Local KA (Key Assignments) back on
RENMFL::    Renames an X-Mem file. Alpha contains OLDNAME,NEWNAME
RETPFL::   Re-types an X-Mem file. X has the new type value (1 to 15)
SLOW::      Sets SLOW mode for compatibility with legacyModules
WORKFL::  Appends the name of the current ("Working") X-Mem file to ALPHA.

== Modules

Integral part of original HP-41 are pluggable modules.
This chapter explains how to load and manage modules in DM41X.



=== Quick Module Load

This is quick step by step reference how to load module.

You can use btn:[▲], btn:[▼] keys to navigate items.

kbd:[Plug], kbd:[Imprt], etc. corresponds to soft menu items and are activated
by respective first-row key.


//Note that following process expects the module isn't loaded in <<flash_module_area,Flash Module Area>> yet.

*Steps*

_Load `.mod` file to DM41X_

. First you need to prepare module as `.mod` file
. Copy `.mod` file to calculator's FAT disk (preferably to the `/MODS` directory) +
  See <<activate_usb_disk,Activate USB disk>> how to copy files to calculator's FAT disk.

_Load `.mod` file to internal Flash Module area_

[start=3]
. Navigate to `SETUP -> Module -> Active Modules -> kbd:[Plug] -> kbd:[Imprt]` +
. Select `.mod` file from the file list, press btn:[ENTER] to load. +
  Now you should see list of modules present in Flash Module area

_Add module to the 'Active Modules' list_

[start=5]
. Select your module and press kbd:[Add] key from soft menu.
  You should see `Active Modules` screen +
. Press btn:[ENTER] to accept `Active Modules` list. +
  Now the module should be active.





[[plug_printer_module]]
=== Plug-in Printer Module

This is quick step by step reference how to activate printer module.

*Steps*

. Navigate to `SETUP -> Module ->Active Modules`.
. Press kbd:[Plug].
. Select `Thermal Printer` and press kbd:[Add] or btn:[ENTER] +
  `Thermal Printer` module should be in `Active Modules` list now.
. Press btn:[ENTER] to accept new `Active Modules` list.





=== Supported Module formats

DM41X is able to load and use usual `.mod` files only.


However you can always pack ROM file(s) into `.mod` on PC and use resulting `.mod` file at DM41X.



[[flash_module_area]]
=== Flash Module Area


'Flash Module Area' is special region of flash memory dedicated for module use. It is the only place from
where the emulator can access module ROMs and run module code.

That implies all modules before <<activating_modules, activation>> have to be loaded to 'Flash Module Area'.

Tools for module management in 'Flash Module Area' are accessible from screen
`SETUP -> Module -> <<manage_modules_in_flash, Manage Modules in Flash>>`.




[[module_id_in_flash]]
==== Module identification in flash

Flash Module Area can only be populated by loading module files from FAT disk. Original path of each
loaded `.mod` file is stored by load process in flash along the module data.

NOTE: You can check the module filename in flash by going to Setup -> Module -> Manage Modules in Flash,
then select appropriate module and use kbd:[Mod] to display module info.

A *module is considered to be loaded* in flash if its filename (i.e. without directory) is the same
using case insensitive comparison.








[[backup_module_lists]]
=== Backup Module Lists


This functionality allows to save and load list of modules stored in
<<active_modules,Active Modules>> (AM) list.
Also allows to save list of currently loaded modules in <<flash_module_area,flash module area>>.
Further, contents of _flash module area_ can be restored based on the saved module list
(which requires corresponding `.mod` files to be present on FAT disk).

Module lists are saved into `.m41` files, default load/save directory is `/STATE`. +
The `.m41` file contains only list of module filenames and flags whether the particular module
is active (i.e. comes to both AM list and _flash module area_)
or is non-active and should be stored into _flash module area_ only.


[NOTE]
====
{blank}

- Both `Save AM List only` and `Save Flash and AM Lists` create `.m41` files only.
- `Load AM List` requires all modules to be already present in flash.
- `Load Flash and AM List` and `Load Flash, clear AM List` require actual module files

on real calculator.

Note that it is possible to plug-in only modules present in <<flash_module_area,Flash Module Area>>.


*Steps*

. Activate kbd:[Plug] from 'Active Modules' screen: +
  `SETUP -> Module -> Active Modules -> kbd:[Plug]`

. List of modules from <<flash_module_area,Flash Module Area>> is displayed
+
image::add_module.png[]

. If required module isn't present in the list you can import module from disk using
  kbd:[Imprt] now.

. Select required module from list and press kbd:[Add] or btn:[ENTER] to add module
  to 'Active Modules' list. +
  You should see `Active Modules` screen now.

. Press btn:[ENTER] to accept `Active Modules` list. +
  Now the module should be active.


==== Troubleshooting

Actual layout of loaded modules could be seen in <<module_rom_map,ROM Map screen>>.

////
WARNING: Note that this functionality could be available only in beta version.

Result of current address assignment to module ROMs is stored in root of FAT disk in `rominit.log` file.

See <<module_loader,Module Loader>> section for details.
////



=== Internals


[[module_loader]]
==== Module Loader

This section describes procedure for ROM address assignment.

Each time module is plugged or unplugged `Module Loader` assigns locations of ROMs to active modules.



For each step number below are all active modules processed in order specified in `Active Modules` screen:

Pass 0:::
ROMs assigned in `.mod` files to fixed pages go exactly there.

Pass 1:::
Others ROMs are assigned to pages 8-F in order of appearance - first those with prescribed
mutual relative positions (in single `.mod` file).

Pass 2:::
Finally ROMs using single pages with no other requirements are placed at free pages.


NOTE: Note that in above-mentioned steps ROM refers to item in `.mod` file which can actually
 represent also RAM page.



////

Result of this process is available in `rominit.log` file located in root of FAT disk.

WARNING: Note that starting with firmware 1.12 the creation of `rominit.log` is disabled.

[[ram_pages]]
==== RAM pages

Any module can define its own RAM (in `.mod` file) and subsequently access it using WROM(WMLDL) and CXISA(FETCH S&X).
HEPAX instructions WPTOG and BLKMOV are implemented too.

*If you are going to use RAM pages in multiple modules or you want to change modules which uses RAM pages:*

WARNING: The contents of RAM pages are internally linked to the order of RAM pages requested during module load.
That means these contents are strictly tied to a particular configuration of modules containing RAM pages.
We recommend you make RAM backup (or full backup) whenever you change configuration of RAM modules unless
you really understand the consequences.
// (see. <<ram_pages,RAM Pages>> section for more details).


RAM pages are initialized when the module is used (<<activating_modules,plugged-in>>) for the first time after loading Flash from FAT;
RAM page contents are loaded with data from the appropriate RAM page of the .mod file. In most cases
this means the RAM is cleared, however this allows the user to create a module with pre-filled RAM
contents. Otherwise the contents is preserved during all plug/unplug(s) of modules. Note that changes
to these RAM pages are not saved to the .mod file, however you can save the complete RAM contents
as described here and in the <<save_ram_pages,Save RAM Pages>> section.



System offers 8 RAM pages organized as ordered list called `RAM Area`.
RAM pages from this area are linked to modules by
<<module_loader,Module Loader>> in order as they are requested by modules.
Thus RAM pages are assigned in the same way for the same module configuration preserving the
correct RAM contents for modules.

As a consequence moving modules containing RAM pages doesn't harm their RAM contents as far as
all modules with RAM preserve the same order in <<active_modules,Active Modules>> list and
module itself is able to handle RAM page changes.


It is possible to load and save contents of `RAM Area` using
<<load_ram_pages,Load RAM Pages>> and <<save_ram_pages,Save RAM Pages>> commands.

<<load_ram_pages,Load RAM Pages>> loads all pages from the file to the beginning of
the `RAM Area`. Thus contents of RAM pages can be loaded before activating module
which will use those pages.

Note that when loading a saved file that has more pages than are currently allocated,
the additional pages will still be loaded into the following unallocated space.
Thus, if/when allocated to another module in the future, these pages will contain the same contents
as when loaded. If intended for other use, you may need to clear those pages before use.

<<save_ram_pages,Save RAM Pages>> saves currently used pages from `RAM Area`.

== Program Decoder/Encoder


There is state file decoder/encoder available at http://technical.swissmicros.com/decoders/dm41/.

Besides loading of contents of state files (which has to be copied into "Dump from calc:" window).
It also allows to load `.raw` program files.

For more details follow the encoder link and look into "Quick Ref" tab.

NOTE: (_To be implemented..._) Note that this utility is originally designed for DM41 and needs
update to fully support all features of DM41X.

  references to the "EXIT" key which means to press the btn:[<-] on DM41X.
// instead.


[[main_setup_menu]]
=== Main Setup menu

Main 'Setup menu' could be entered by pressing btn:[SHIFT]+btn:[SETUP].

From there other sub-menus could be entered or about screen displayed

1. <<file_menu,File menu>>
2. <<module_menu, Module menu>>
3. <<settings_menu,Settings menu>>
4. <<system_menu, System menu>>
5. About > Displays About screen.




[[file_menu]]
=== File menu

[[load_state]]
==== Load DM41 State File >
Used for loading the `.d41` state files. By default from the `/STATE/` directory of the FAT disk.

Note that this loads only calculator memory and doesn't affect state of currently loaded modules.

To load calculator state

- Select the program to load using the btn:[▲] and btn:[▼] keys
- btn:[ENTER] to load the selected state file
- Warning is displayed that current calculator state will be lost. Proceed with btn:[ENTER].

Then calculator state is updated from the selected file.


[[save_state]]
==== Save DM41 State File >
Used for saving calculator's state (i.e. contents of memory and CPU registers) to a `.d41` state file. By default to the `/STATE/` directory of the FAT disk.

- Select file from list (for overwrite) or `<New File>` if you want to enter new filename. +
  Confirm with btn:[ENTER]
- [On `<New File>`] Enter new filename. btn:[SHIFT] toggles input mode between lower/upper case and numbers. +
  Confirm with btn:[R/S] or btn:[Alpha].

Then calculator state is saved to selected file.



[[load_raw_pgm]]
==== Load RAW Program >
Used for loading the `.raw` program file from FAT disk. By default from the `/PROG/` directory of the FAT disk.

This is functional equivalent of `GETP` extended memory command. Only this reads from FAT disk instead of extended memory.

To load program file:

- Select the program to load using the btn:[▲] and btn:[▼] keys
- btn:[ENTER] to load the selected program file

The program is loaded into calculator memory.



[[save_raw_pgm]]
==== Save RAW Program >
Used for saving program to a `.raw` file to FAT disk. By default to the `/PROG/` directory of the FAT disk.

This is functional equivalent of `SAVEP` extended memory command. Only this writes to FAT disk instead of extended memory.

// Note that the program name to save has to be prepared in ALPHA register.

- Put the name of the program (the topmost global label) you want to save in Alpha.
+
Note that you can save the current program (the one you are actively in,
seen in line 3 of SI mode) by ensuring that Alpha is clear.
+
Also note that for filenames, a key difference is that in a CX, the program name can
use any 41 characters to make up the filename, whereas when exporting to USB storage,
you must use only 'normal' characters for the filename. So you can't specify 41-unique
characters in the filename such as '%', '↑', 'Σ', etc.

- Select file from list (for overwrite) or `<New File>` if you want to enter new filename. +
  Confirm with btn:[ENTER]
- [On `<New File>`] Enter new filename. btn:[SHIFT] toggles input mode between lower/upper case and numbers. +
  Confirm with btn:[R/S] or btn:[Alpha].

The program is saved from calculator memory to FAT disk.



[[activate_usb_disk]]
==== Activate USB Disk

Used to copy files from/to a host computer - e.g. backup/restore the calculator state files from `/STATE/` directory or read/write programs in RAW format into the `/PROG/` directory.

:exitkey: btn:[<-] or btn:[ON] key

- Connect the calculator to a computer using a USB cable
- The DM41X's flash disk should be visible on the computer
- Read/write files
- 'Eject device' on the host machine.
- Calculator should end USB disk mode automatically if correctly ejected by OS. +
You can also end USB disk mode by pressing {exitkey} on the calculator followed by btn:[ENTER] key for
confirmation, but be sure all data are flushed to disk first.

WARNING: The last two points 'Eject device' and eventually 'Press {exitkey} on calculator' if USB disk mode doesn't end automatically are important to avoid unsaved data and possible FAT disk corruption!


====
*For Windows users* +
In Windows you can eject the disk in two different ways:

A. _(Prefered)_ Right-Click on the drive in any Explorer view and select "Eject" and the DM41X should leave USB Disk mode automatically.

B. Click the "Safely remove hardware and eject media" icon in the tray, then select DM41X from the list of devices to eject. After you see the "Safe to remove hardware message" press {exitkey} followed by btn:[ENTER] key for confirmation to exit USB Disk mode.
