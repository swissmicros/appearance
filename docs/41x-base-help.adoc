System Control and Misc

SLOW:: Sets SLOW mode for compatibility with legacy Modules
FAST:: Restores FAST mode
FILL:: Fills the stack with the value in X
X<I>Y:: Exchanges the contents of IND X and IND Y
TRNG:: Time-Based (True) Random Number Generator
LKAOFF:: Turns Local KA (Key Assignments) off, i.e. those assigned to the two top rows
LKAON:: Turns Local KA (Key Assignments) back on


Alpha Functions

ABSP:: ALPHA Back Space. Deletes the rightmost char in ALPHA
AINT:: Appends integer value from Reg X to ALPHA (includes sign)
ASWAP:: Swaps ALPHA strings around the comma characters, i.e. A,B changes to B,A
CLAC:: Clears ALPHA after the comma character, i.e. A,B changes to A,


Extended Memory Functions:

CLEM:: Clears all Extended Memory

ED$:: Enhanced ASCII File Editor with support for lower-case and special characters.
The operation is controlled by the status of the ALPHA annunciator.
ALPHA On is the standard mode, selected when you first enter the editor.
Switch ALPHA OFF to access non-keyable characters in the standard mode.
Use the shifted keys to access the lower-case characters and the un-shifted keys to access the special characters.

FLCOPY:: Copies the content of a file into another. Both files must exist and be of the same type. The destination file should be of equal size or larger than the source file.

FLHD:: Returns to X the address (in decimal) of the File Header. Stack lifts if CPU F11 is set
FLTYPE:: Returns to X the type of the file, ie. 1 for program, 2 for Data, etc. Stack lifts if CPU F11 is set
RENMFL:: Renames an X-Mem file. Alpha contains OLDNAME,NEWNAME
RETPFL:: Re-types an X-Mem file. X has the new type value (1 to 15)
WORKFL:: Appends the name of the current ("Working") X-Mem file to ALPHA.
