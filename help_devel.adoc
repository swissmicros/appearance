[[about_help]]
=== About Help Browser

The DMCP system supports extremely lightweight implementation of HTML
which covers just small fraction of the format. Almost all supported
formatting is used in this help file. +
If you want to write your own help file it is strongly recommended to
take this help file as starting point and follow the structure of the
HTML. Then check the appearance in calculator browser, whether it looks
as expected. +
 +
See "link:#help_chars[Special characters available]" for list of
supported characters in help file. +
